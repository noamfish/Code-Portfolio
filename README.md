# Code-Portfolio
Created to display portions of my projects to friends or curious employers.
The current additions to this portfolio are parts of my current RTS project. 
I have chosen these as I believe they are some of my best examples of well written code and strong object encapsulation.

This folders *State Machine* and *Unit Scripts* contain everything to do with my handling of unit interactions in the game.  
Each unit has compositional components, which encapsulate their different functions, but work together using a statemachine to simplify capabilities at a given time.
